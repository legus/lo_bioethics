							<h1>Bioethics Applied to Law</h1>

									<img src="imagenes/imagen.png" width="150px" class="img_right">
									Bioethics tends to recognize the plurality of the moral options present in the current societies advocating the need to establish minimum agreements. The proceedings which allow consensual decisions are permitted. If there's no agreement, Law should establish the limitations of what's allowed.<br>From there comes the close relationship between Bioethics and Law, taken as a norm of conduct that springs out from everybody's will.<br>It´s evident and easy to confirm that the subjects dealt with by the Bioethics  have an immediate response in the judicial, legislative and the jurisprudent  fields, as well as the point of view of the practical interest of those who work in these areas, whose new implications and responsibilities prove to be very problematic.<br><br><strong>Bioethics And Human Rights</strong> As the practices that go beyond the national boundaries multiply themselves without a regulating frame, such as the experiments in the biochemist world, the field of import and the export of embryos and mother cells of organs, tissues and cells and the circulation of tissues or samples of AND's and genetic data, you can feel the need to give shape to some ethical principles.<br>Maybe the  most emblematic proof of the relation between human rights and bioethics came on October 9th, 2005 when the  General Conference of the UNESCO adopted  by huge acclaim the Universal  Declaration of  Bioethics and Human Rights, which dealt  with “the ethical items related with medicine, the sciences of life and the applied technologies of human beings, bearing in mind  the social, judicial and environmental dimensions”.
